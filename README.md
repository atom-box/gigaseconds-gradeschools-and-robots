# Exercises


##  General set up for Exercism   
1. Download the command line tool
`sudo snap install exercism`
2.  Configure the CLI settings.  I used their generic token from the settings page:
`exercism configure --token=e1393a92-1d53-4888-b298-22233062b100` Configuring with my individual token from the about page for some reason did not work.  Is the site actually on hiatus?
3.  Choose a language, browse its track, download the tests for that exercise:
`exercism download --exercise=grade-school --track=php
`
4. Write any code you want until the tests all pass.
 
## Exercise 1: Grade School
### Description 
Given students' names along with the grade that they are in, create a roster
for the school.

User stories.   

* Teachers should be able to add a student's name to the roster for a grade
  - "Add Jim to grade 2."
  - "OK."
* Teachers should be able to get a list of all students enrolled in a grade
  - "Which students are in grade 2?"
  - "We've only got Jim just now."
* Teachers should be able to get a sorted list of all students in all grades.  Grades should sort
  as 1, 2, 3, etc., and students within a grade should be sorted
  alphabetically by name.
  - "Who all is enrolled in school right now?"
  - "Grade 1: Anna, Barb, and Charlie. Grade 2: Alex, Peter, and Zoe.
    Grade 3â€¦"
